# Polya practice: What's your degree worth?

In the U.S., the average salary of a high school graduate is [$35,256](https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-average-salary-by-education-level) / year, and the average salary of a GW graduate is
<a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/School=George_Washington_University_(GWU)/Salary">$76,151</a>. However, GW grads pay an average of $70,000 / year (tuition + fees + housing) for 4 years for their degree, and high school grads are working that entire time. Assuming immediate employment after graduation, how many years after graduating will the GW grad need to work until their net income (salary minus cost of education) surpasses that of the average high school graduate? (This is a _very_ rough estimate - you can assume away interest rates, inflation, promotions / salary raises, etc.)

Take 5 minutes to restate the problem & devise a plan (don't carry it out!)

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# 1)
# How many years after graduating and earning money will a college grad's net income surpass that of a high school grad, accounting for added cost of education?
salary_hs <- 35256
salary_gw <- 76151
gw_annual_cost <- 70000
years_in_college <- 4

# 2)
# Find income gap when gw grad starts
income_gap_start <- years_in_college*(salary_hs + gw_annual_cost)

# Find the annual salary surplus of gw grad compared to hs grad
gw_annual_surplus <- salary_gw - salary_hs

# Divide annual income surplus into income starting gap
ceiling(income_gap_start / gw_annual_surplus)

# 4)
# Check intermediate values
income_gap_start
gw_annual_surplus
# Can we ask a different question? What would my salary need to be to cut that to just 5 years?
(income_gap_start / 5) + salary_hs
```

# Think-Pair-Share

Kevin is deciding between purchasing a Toyota Prius, which sells for $27,600, and a Toyota Camry, which sells for $24,000. He knows that based on his driving patterns he can get an average fuel economy of 55 miles per gallon (mpg) of gasoline in the Prius but only 28 mpg in the Camry on average. He also knows that he typically drives 12,000 miles each year, and the average price of gasoline is $2.20 / gallon.

How long (in years) would Kevin have to drive the Prius for the money he saves in fuel savings to be greater than the price premium compared to the Camry?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
price_prius <- 27600
price_camry <- 24000
mpg_prius <- 55
mpg_camry <- 28
annual_miles <- 12000
price_gas <- 2.20 # per gallon

# 1) When will the fuel savings from driving the Prius surpass it's price premium compared to the Camry?

# 2)
# Find the price difference:
price_diff <- price_prius - price_camry

# Find the fuel cost difference:
annual_gallons_prius <- annual_miles / mpg_prius
annual_gallons_camry <- annual_miles / mpg_camry
annual_gallons_diff <- annual_gallons_camry - annual_gallons_prius
annual_fuel_cost_diff <- price_gas*annual_gallons_diff

# Divide these two
price_diff / annual_fuel_cost_diff

# 4) Can I solve this differently?
# What would the price of gas need to be to get that down to 3 years?
(price_diff / 3) / annual_gallons_diff
```
