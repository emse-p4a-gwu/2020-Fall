Planned outline:

1:
- Welcome.
- Use slack for questions
    - Keeps messaging separate from video
    - Keeps a record (you can review this later)
- If not on the slack yet, use link in BB announcement
- Use reactions in Zoom!
- If you don't mind, turn your video on

4 - 6:
- Personal intros
- Let Saurav and Jenny speak

7:
- Look at schedule,
- Note no class on election

8:
- Concepts from class and HW will overlap, so completing on time is critical

13:
- when you write code, you leave finger prints behind
- I do use software to automate checking for those finger prints

15:
- show link in website menu

21:
- Brief history of R: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html

23:
- Embrace the errors!

27:
- There are other data types, not just numbers.
- We'll talk about them at the end of today
 
29:
- Where spacing matters: can't add spaces within numbers

35:
- Show where in RStudio to create the projects

58:
- Shorthand - you can use just T and F

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Post-class notes

- Post recording to youtube playlist
- Add brief history of R on slide 21: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html
- Add content on restarting R
- Ran out of time on practice sessions - could maybe move data types to w2
