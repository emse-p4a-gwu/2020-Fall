### 1. **Split** the data into groups
### 2. **Apply** some analysis to each group
### 3. **Combine** the results

## Split-apply-combine with `group_by`

Compute the mean band member age for **each band**
```{r}
bands %>%
    mutate(
        age = 2019 - yearOfBirth,
        mean_age = mean(age)) # This is the mean across both bands #<<
```

---
## Split-apply-combine with `group_by`

Compute the mean band member age for each band
```{r}
bands %>%
    mutate(age = 2019 - yearOfBirth) %>%
    group_by(band) %>% # Everything after this will be done each band #<<
    mutate(mean_age = mean(age))

## Summarize data frames with `summarise()`

Compute the mean band member age for **each band**
```{r}
bands %>%
    mutate(age = 2019 - yearOfBirth) %>%
    group_by(band) %>%
    summarise(mean_age = mean(age)) # Drops all variables except for group #<<
```

---
## Summarize data frames with `summarise()`

Compute the mean, min, and max band member age for **each band**
```{r}
bands %>%
    mutate(age = 2019 - yearOfBirth) %>%
    group_by(band) %>%
    summarise(
        mean_age = mean(age),
        min_age = min(age),
        max_age = max(age))
```

---
## Computing counts of observations with `n()`

How many members are in each band?
```{r}
bands %>%
    mutate(age = 2019 - yearOfBirth) %>%
    group_by(band) %>%
    summarise(
        mean_age = mean(age),
        min_age = min(age),
        max_age = max(age),
        numMembers = n()) #<<
```

---
## If you only want a quick count, use `count()`

These do the same thing:

.leftcol[
```{r}
bands %>%
    group_by(band) %>% 
    summarise(n = n())
```
]
.rightcol[
```{r}
bands %>%
    count(band) 
```
]

---
## If you only want a quick count, use `count()`

You can count multiple combinations
```{r}
bands %>%
    mutate(nameStartsWithG = str_detect(firstName, '^G')) %>%
    count(band, nameStartsWithG)
```

          update_every = 1,
          top = 0,
          right = 0,
          font_size = '2em')
```

1) Create the data frame object `df` by using `here()` and `read_csv()` to load the `wildlife_impacts.csv` file in the `data` folder.

2) Use the `df` object and `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `count()`, and `%>%` to answer the following questions:

- Create a summary data frame that contains the mean `height` for each different time of day.
- Create a summary data frame that contains the maximum `cost_repairs_infl_adj` for each year.
- Which _month_ has had the greatest number of reported incidents?
- Which _year_ has had the greatest number of reported incidents?

# Exporting data

```{r}
ageSummary <- bands %>%
    mutate(age = 2019 - yearOfBirth) %>%
    group_by(band) %>%
    summarise(
        mean_age = mean(age),
        min_age = min(age),
        max_age = max(age), 
        numMembers = n())
ageSummary
```

---
# Exporting data: `here()` + `write_csv()`

Save the `ageSummary` data frame in your "data" folder:


--
1) Create a path to where you want to save the data
```{r}
library(here)
savePath <- here('data', 'ageSummary.csv')
```
--
2) Export the data
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
write_csv(ageSummary, savePath)
```

Make sure you install the package `nycflights13`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('nycflights13')
```

--
This package includes **5 data frames**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
airlines
airports
flights
planes
weather
```
