# Think of `%>%` as the words "...and then..."

**Without Pipes** (read from inside-out):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
leave_house(get_dressed(get_out_of_bed(wake_up(me))))
```

--
**With Pipes**:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
me %>%
    wake_up %>%
    get_out_of_bed %>%
    get_dressed %>%
    leave_house
```

# Sequence operations with pipes: `%>%`

--
&zwj;Example:
1. Filter the band members born after 1974
2. Select only the columns `firstName` & `lastName`


--
**Without Pipes**:
```{r}
select(filter(spicegirls, yearOfBirth > 1974), firstName, lastName)
```

# Think of the words "...and then..."

**Without Pipes**:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(filter(spicegirls, yearOfBirth > 1974), firstName, lastName)
```

**With Pipes**: Note that you don't need to repeat the dataframe name
```{r, eval=FALSE}
spicegirls %>%
    filter(yearOfBirth > 1974) %>%
    select(firstName, lastName)
```

# Sort rows with `arrange()`

--
Sort the data frame by year of birth:
```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    arrange(yearOfBirth)
```

---
# Sort rows with `arrange()`

Use the `desc()` function to sort in descending order:
```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    arrange(desc(yearOfBirth))
```

---
# Sort rows with `arrange()`

Example of filtering, arranging, and selecting:

```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    filter(yearOfBirth < 1975) %>%
    arrange(desc(yearOfBirth)) %>%
    select(ends_with('name'))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10,
          warn_when = 30,
          update_every = 1,
          top = 0,
          right = 0,
          font_size = '2em')
```

1) Create the data frame object `df` by using `here()` and `read_csv()` to load the `wildlife_impacts.csv` file in the `data` folder.

2) Use the `df` object and `select()`, `filter()`, and `%>%` to answer the following questions:

- Create a new data frame, `dc_dawn`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports that occurred at dawn.
- Create a new data frame, `dc_dawn_birds`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports that occurred at dawn and only the variables (columns) about the species of bird.
- Create a new data frame, `dc_dawn_birds_known`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports that occurred at dawn and only the variables (columns) about the KNOWN species of bird.
- How many _known_ unique species of birds have been involved in accidents at DC airports at dawn?
