# Create new variables with `mutate()`

Example: Use the `yearOfBirth` variable to compute the age of each band member


--
**Base R**:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
spicegirls$age <- 2020 - spicegirls$yearOfBirth
```

--
**dplyr**:
```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    mutate(age = 2020 - yearOfBirth)
```

---
# You can _immediately_ use new variables

```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    select(firstName, lastName, yearOfBirth) %>%
    mutate(
        age = 2020 - yearOfBirth,
        meanAge  = mean(age)) # Immediately using the "age" variable #<<
```

---
# Handle if/else conditions with `ifelse()`

--
### `ifelse(<condition>, <if TRUE>, <else>)`

--
```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    mutate(
        yobEvenOdd = ifelse(yearOfBirth %% 2 == 0, 'even', 'odd'))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10,
          warn_when = 30,
          update_every = 1,
          top = 0,
          right = 0,
          font_size = '2em')
```

## Think pair share

1) Create the data frame object `df` by using `here()` and `read_csv()` to load the `wildlife_impacts.csv` file in the `data` folder.

2) Use the `df` object with `%>%` and `mutate()` to create the following new variables:

- `height_miles`: The `height` variable converted to miles (Hint: there are 5,280 feet in a mile).
- `cost_mil`: Is `TRUE` if the repair costs was greater or equal to $1 million, `FALSE` otherwise.
- `season`: One of four seasons based on the `incident_month` variable:

  - `spring`: March, April, May
  - `summer`: June, July, August
  - `fall`: September, October, November
  - `winter`: December, January, February
