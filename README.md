### Description

This course provides a foundation in programming for analytics using the
[R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). Topics covered
include fundamentals of the R programming language (operators, data
types, objects, functions, conditionals, loops, strings, testing,
debugging, Monte Carlo methods) as well as techniques for working with
data in R (projects & directories, packages, file input/output, data
structures, data wrangling, and data visualization). Emphasis will be on
producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down
design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Students
will primarily work on individual programming assignments to help
practice problem solving skills, coding skills, and data science skills.
Students will be assessed through quizzes, homework assignments, and
exams. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of time
spent live coding and working on practice problems in class. This course
assumes no prior programming experience and is an ideal preparation for
higher level courses in data analytics.
